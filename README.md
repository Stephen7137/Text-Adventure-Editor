# Text-Adventure-Editor
The project is a editor for creating text adventure

PROJECT CANCELED:
The project has gone past the time planned for this project. Code has become inefficent as the project
has had some changes and requires elements that would require the engine to be redone.

The is a personal project to create a editor that was capable of creating, editing, and maintain
a text adventure capable of a branching stories using JavaFX as the GUI. The Chapter was storied 
in to a tree structure and would use the starting node to travel down the tree. The manager is 
able to edit every node except for the title, as well as able to connect and 
disconnect the nodes.
