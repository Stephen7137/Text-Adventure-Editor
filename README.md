Overview tab is a simulation of how the story will look as the story plays out 
in the console. There is a text box for input for the option input, and a 
enter button to input the users choose or proceed to the next part of the story.

Story Tree tab shows how all the nodes are connected and allows to manipulated 
the nodes and their connection between each other. This tab also allows to 
create and delete nodes from the tree, allowing to shrink and grow the story.

Select Node tab is a console view of a current node and the child/children. 
The main use of this tab is to make sure option nodes display their children 
correctly and are connected properly so there is no miss alignment with the 
story's options.
